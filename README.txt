The µMaple Kernel and System Architecture
Joel Machens - 2022

Using µMaple
µMaple is nothing but a memory manager and scheduler, by no means a complete system and by even less a way of booting or operating a computer. µMaple is compliant with Multiboot, STIVALE2, and MLOAD, a tiny Maple-developed loader for x86 BIOS systems.

Specification

Language:
MUST is not optional, and needs to be implemented for a complete µMaple Kernel.
SHOULD is technically optional, but should be implemented wherever possible.
CAN is optional, and the specification makes no regard as to if it is or isn't implemented
